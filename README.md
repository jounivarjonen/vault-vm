# How to Migrate HashiCorp Vault to New Cluster using Raft Backend?

It seems like you are asking how to migrate HashiCorp Vault to a new cluster using a Raft backend. Raft is a highly available, distributed, and consistent storage system that is easy to understand, implement, and operate. It has been integrated into Vault to provide a robust storage backend that supports clustering and high availability.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to migrate HashiCorp Vault to a new cluster using the Raft backend:

1. **Take a Backup:** Before starting the migration, take a snapshot of the current data stored in the Vault using the `vault operator raft snapshot save` command. Save this backup to a safe location.

```shell
vault operator raft snapshot save backup.snap
Prepare the New Vault Cluster: Set up a new Vault cluster with the desired number of nodes. Configure the Raft backend in the Vault configuration file (usually config.hcl) for each node in the new cluster.
hcl
Copy code
storage "raft" {
  path = "/path/to/raft/data"
  node_id = "node1"
}

listener "tcp" {
  address     = "0.0.0.0:8200"
  tls_disable = "true"
}

api_addr = "http://<your_node_ip_or_fqdn>:8200"
cluster_addr = "https://<your_node_ip_or_fqdn>:8201"
Make sure to replace <your_node_ip_or_fqdn> with the IP address or FQDN of each node.

Initialize the New Raft Cluster: Start the new Vault cluster by running the Vault server with the Raft configuration file. Initialize the cluster using the vault operator init command, which will return a set of unseal keys and the initial root token.
shell
Copy code
vault operator init
Unseal the New Vault Nodes: Use the unseal keys from the previous step to unseal all the nodes in the new cluster. Use the vault operator unseal command to unseal each node.
shell
Copy code
vault operator unseal <unseal_key>
Join Other Nodes to the Raft Cluster: If you have more than one node in the new cluster, join them using the vault operator raft join command.
shell
Copy code
vault operator raft join http://<leader_node_ip_or_fqdn>:8200
Restore the Snapshot to the New Cluster: Use the vault operator raft snapshot restore command to restore the backup taken in step 1 to the new cluster.
shell
Copy code
vault operator raft snapshot restore backup.snap
Verify the Data: Log in to the new cluster using the initial root token and verify that the data has been migrated successfully.
shell
Copy code
vault login <initial_root_token>
vault kv list secret/
Update Clients: Update all clients, applications, and services to use the new Vault cluster's API address.
Decommission the Old Cluster: Once you have verified that the new cluster is operational and all clients have been updated, you can decommission the old Vault cluster.
By following these steps, you can successfully migrate HashiCorp Vault to a new cluster using the Raft backend.
